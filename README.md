# FHS
Football History Simulator v2.0


To @Kardyne (and anybody else who might read this):
- currently only the team generator and the league competitions are usable
- use the generator to generate some teams (Option 1 of the CLI interface)
- then run a league (option 4 of the CLI interface)
- an example of a league configuration file is included in test.json, use it to run a test league
(you can modify it to try other configurations)
