This class implements a genetic SpecialTieBreaker class

SpecialTiebreakers are tiebreakers which are too specific to be implemented using the generic Tiebreaker class

These tiebreakers need to be hardcoded in the competition managers, so be careful with implementing new tiebreakers.
You will have to mess with the competitions managers
